# Introduction
{% blockquote Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning%}
*Deep learning*(deep structured learning, hierarchical learning or deep machine learning) is a 
branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abst
-ractions in data by using multiple processing layers, with complex structures or otherwise, 
composed of multiple non-linear transformations.
{% endblockquote %}

Here are some references about learning procedures *from the perspective of beginners* and sharing
some resoures with deep learning about how beginners learned step by step.
